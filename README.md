# Chalkboard WebRTC
Projects I created while learning WebRTC which use Firebase for signaling. These are set up to use fixed rooms for each demo and only support up to 2 participants unless otherwise indicated. They're intended to be tested by opening separate browser tabs navigated to the same page.

- [Media Devices](https://github.com/Sammy-T/chalkboard-webrtc/tree/master/public/media-devices) - Accessing media devices/screen share
- [Peer Connection](https://github.com/Sammy-T/chalkboard-webrtc/tree/master/public/peer-connection) - Sending text messages over a peer connection
- [Media Connection](https://github.com/Sammy-T/chalkboard-webrtc/tree/master/public/media-connection) - Transmitting camera streams over a peer connection
- [Mesh Peer Connection](https://github.com/Sammy-T/chalkboard-webrtc/tree/master/public/mesh-peer-connection) - Sending text messages over a peer connection which scales to multiple participants **
- [Media Connection Variable](https://github.com/Sammy-T/chalkboard-webrtc/tree/master/public/media-connection-variable) - Upgrading audio connection with video

** Supports over 2 participants however this mesh topology wouldn't scale well to numerous participants
